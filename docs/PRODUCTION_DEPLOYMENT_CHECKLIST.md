# ASP Cranes CRM - Production Deployment Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying the ASP Cranes CRM application to a private cloud in a production environment. Following these steps will ensure a secure and stable deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Preparations

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production` for build process
- [ ] Configure API endpoint in environment variables
- [ ] Set secure JWT secret for production use
- [ ] Set up database connection strings

### 2. Production Build
- [ ] Run `npm run build:prod:win` on Windows or `npm run build:prod` on Linux/Mac
- [ ] Verify that no development code is included in the production bundle
- [ ] Check for any build warnings or errors
- [ ] Test the production build locally using `npm run preview`

### 3. Security Review
- [ ] Ensure all development authentication bypasses are removed
- [ ] Verify JWT token handling is secure
- [ ] Review API authentication flow
- [ ] Check that environment-specific code behaves correctly
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive data is exposed in client code

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Server Preparation
- [ ] Set up server environment with Node.js v16+ (if running Node.js server)
- [ ] Configure web server (Nginx, Apache, IIS) for static file hosting
- [ ] Set up HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure proper security headers

### 2. Application Deployment
- [ ] Upload production build (`dist` directory) to server
- [ ] Set required environment variables on server
- [ ] Configure web server to serve the SPA correctly (with history API fallback)
- [ ] Set up API proxying if needed

### 3. Database Setup
- [ ] Ensure database is properly secured
- [ ] Set up backups and monitoring
- [ ] Validate connection from application to database

### 4. Security Measures
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only (HTTP to HTTPS redirection)
- [ ] Set up Content Security Policy
- [ ] Configure rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Application Checks
- [ ] Verify application loads successfully
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify protected routes work correctly
- [ ] Check that API calls function properly

### 2. Security Tests
- [ ] Verify no development features are accessible
- [ ] Check for proper JWT validation
- [ ] Test session timeout and token refresh
- [ ] Verify security headers are correctly set

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Check that JWT secret is properly set
   - Verify API endpoints are correctly configured

2. **API Connection Issues**
   - Verify API URL configuration
   - Check network configuration and firewalls
   - Review API logs for errors

3. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Review server logs for backend issues
   - Verify all assets are loading correctly

## Maintenance

### Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Set up monitoring for application performance
- [ ] Configure alerting for critical errors
- [ ] Establish backup procedures
- [ ] Create a update/deployment strategy for future releases
