# Quotations PostgreSQL Integration

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully integrated the Quotations functionality with PostgreSQL storage in the ASP Cranes CRM application. The integration includes:

1. **Backend API Routes**
   - Created comprehensive API endpoints for quotation management in `quotationRoutes.mjs`
   - Implemented database table creation and schema definition
   - Added proper error handling and authentication protection

2. **Data Repository**
   - Updated `quotationRepository.ts` to use the API endpoints instead of mock data
   - Implemented all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Added specialized endpoints for quotation status management and filtering

3. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation on the integration in `docs/quotation-integration.md`
   - Added testing instructions in `docs/testing-quotation-api.md`

4. **Testing**
   - Created a comprehensive test script in `scripts/test-quotation-api.mjs`
   - Tests include all API operations and error handling

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints have been implemented:

- `GET /api/quotations` - Get all quotations
- `GET /api/quotations/:id` - Get a specific quotation by ID
- `POST /api/quotations` - Create a new quotation
- `PUT /api/quotations/:id` - Update a quotation
- `PATCH /api/quotations/:id/status` - Update a quotation's status
- `DELETE /api/quotations/:id` - Delete a quotation
- `GET /api/quotations/lead/:leadId` - Get all quotations for a specific lead

## Database Schema

The quotations table schema includes:

- `id`: Primary key, uniquely identifies each quotation
- `lead_id`: Reference to the lead that the quotation is associated with
- `customer_id` and `customer_name`: Customer information
- `customer_contact`: JSON object with customer contact details
- `machine_type`: Type of machinery being quoted
- `selected_equipment`: JSON object with details of the selected equipment
- `selected_machines`: JSON array of selected machines
- Various fields for order details, calculations, and pricing
- `status`: Current status of the quotation ('draft', 'sent', 'accepted', 'rejected')
- `version`: For tracking changes and versioning
- `created_by`, `created_at`, `updated_at`: Audit trail information

## Next Steps

1. **UI Implementation**
   - Implement UI components for quotation management
   - Add forms for creating and editing quotations
   - Create a quotation listing and detail view

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - PDF generation for quotations
   - Email integration for sending quotations
   - Approval workflow
   - Integration with deals and leads

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Comprehensive end-to-end testing
   - Load testing for performance optimization
   - User acceptance testing

## How to Use

The frontend service is already set up to use these endpoints. See `src/services/quotationService.ts` for available methods and usage examples.

To run tests, refer to the testing documentation in `docs/testing-quotation-api.md`.
