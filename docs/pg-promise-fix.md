# Fix for pg-promise Import Issue

## Problem
The application was experiencing an error where the `pg-promise` package could not be found when imported from `configRepository.js`. This was causing server crashes with the error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'pg-promise' imported from C:\Users\Vedant Singh Thakur\Downloads\bolt-asp-crm - Copy\project\src\services\postgres\configRepository.js
```

## Solution
We fixed the issue by replacing `pg-promise` with direct `pg` (PostgreSQL) usage in the configuration repository. 

Changes made:
1. Removed the import of `pg-promise` from `configRepository.js`
2. Added direct import of `pg` package
3. Replaced `pgp` initialization with the standard `pg.Pool` creation
4. Updated all database queries to use the `pool.query()` method instead of pg-promise's methods
5. Added proper connection pool cleanup with `closeConfigDatabase()` function
6. Updated the pg-promise server bridge to handle import errors more gracefully
7. Added test scripts for verifying the fix

## Testing
To test the fix, start the server and run the Config API test:

```
npm run server:improved
npm run test:config-api
```

## Benefits
- Uses the simpler `pg` library directly without the need for `pg-promise`
- More robust error handling and graceful fallbacks
- Proper connection pool management
- Clear separation of server and client-side code

## Additional Notes
You may still want to keep `pg-promise` installed as a development dependency for other parts of the application that might rely on it. The fix ensures that the configuration repository works correctly even if `pg-promise` is not available or has issues.
