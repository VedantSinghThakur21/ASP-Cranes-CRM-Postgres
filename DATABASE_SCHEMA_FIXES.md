# Database Schema Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes applied to the ASP Cranes CRM database schema to resolve foreign key issues, enforce proper constraints, and ensure production-ready data integrity.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Foreign Key Constraints
**Problem**: Several tables were missing critical foreign key relationships, leading to potential data integrity issues.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `deal_id` foreign key to `quotations` table referencing `deals(id)`
- ✅ Ensured all existing foreign key relationships are properly defined
- ✅ Added proper CASCADE/SET NULL behaviors for all foreign keys

### 2. Nullable Fields That Should Be NOT NULL
**Problem**: Critical business fields were nullable when they should enforce data presence.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ `quotations.customer_id` → NOT NULL (every quotation must have a customer)
- ✅ `quotations.created_by` → NOT NULL (every quotation must have a creator)
- ✅ `quotations.total_cost` → NOT NULL (every quotation must have a cost)
- ✅ `deals.customer_id` → NOT NULL (every deal must have a customer)
- ✅ `deals.created_by` → NOT NULL (every deal must have a creator)
- ✅ `deals.assigned_to` → NOT NULL (every deal must be assigned)
- ✅ `jobs.customer_id` → NOT NULL (every job must have a customer)
- ✅ `jobs.created_by` → NOT NULL (every job must have a creator)
- ✅ `leads.assigned_to` → NOT NULL (every lead must be assigned)
- ✅ `site_assessments.customer_id` → NOT NULL (every assessment must have a customer)
- ✅ `site_assessments.created_by` → NOT NULL (every assessment must have a creator)
- ✅ `quotation_templates.created_by` → NOT NULL (every template must have a creator)

### 3. Missing Columns
**Problem**: Tables were missing important business fields.

**Added:**
- ✅ `quotations.deal_id` - Links quotations to deals
- ✅ `quotations.total_cost` - Total calculated cost of quotation
- ✅ `quotations.notes` - Additional notes for quotations
- ✅ `deals.customer_contact` - Customer contact information in deals

### 4. Business Logic Constraints
**Problem**: No enforcement of business rules at the database level.

**Added:**
- ✅ `quotation_must_have_deal_or_lead` - Every quotation must be linked to either a deal or a lead
- ✅ `check_job_dates` - Job end date must be >= start date
- ✅ `check_job_actual_dates` - Job actual end date must be >= actual start date (if both provided)
- ✅ `check_equipment_capacity_weight` - Equipment must have positive capacity and weight
- ✅ `check_deal_probability` - Deal probability must be between 0 and 100 (if provided)
- ✅ `check_quotation_days_positive` - Quotation days and working hours must be positive

### 5. Missing Indexes for Performance
**Problem**: Missing indexes on foreign key columns and frequently queried fields.

**Added:**
- ✅ `idx_quotations_deal_id` - Index on quotations.deal_id
- ✅ `idx_quotations_created_by` - Index on quotations.created_by
- ✅ `idx_deals_created_by` - Index on deals.created_by
- ✅ `idx_jobs_created_by` - Index on jobs.created_by
- ✅ `idx_site_assessments_created_by` - Index on site_assessments.created_by
- ✅ `idx_quotation_templates_created_by` - Index on quotation_templates.created_by
- ✅ `idx_quotation_templates_is_default` - Index on quotation_templates.is_default
- ✅ Performance indexes on value fields (`deals.value`, `quotations.total_cost`)
- ✅ Compound indexes on junction tables for better join performance

## Entity Relationship (ER) Structure

### Core Business Flow
```
Users → Leads → Deals → Quotations → Jobs
  ↓       ↓       ↓        ↓         ↓
  └── Customers ←─┴────────┴─────────┘
```
